    <p>NBA Live 98 is EA Sports' NBA release for the 1997/1998 NBA season. As the first game in the series to support 3D acceleration, NBA Live 98 featured far superior graphics to its predecessors and was the first to use actual face textures for all players instead of building player faces through the use of generic facial features. It was also the first to feature play-by-play commentary and in-game saves, the latter of which proving to be a very popular and greatly desired feature having only appeared in three games in the series. Fans who had been disappointed with NBA Live 96 and NBA Live 97 tended to view NBA Live 98 more favourably.</p>
